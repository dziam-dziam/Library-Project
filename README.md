# Library Management System (Java)

## Description
A simple Java console application for managing a library.  
It allows adding books, managing users, and changing the status of books (e.g., borrowed, available).  

The project demonstrates knowledge of basic object-oriented programming (OOP), collections, enums, and business logic implementation.

## Features
- Add and remove books
- Manage users
- Change book status (available, borrowed, reserved)
- Handle user states (active, blocked)

## Technologies
- Java (OOP, collections, enums)
- Object-oriented programming (Book, User, Library classes)
- Enums (`BookStates`, `UserStates`)

## Project Structure
- `Book.java` – class representing a book
- `User.java` – class representing a user
- `Library.java` – main logic for managing the library
- `LibraryActivities.java` – operations on resources
- `Main.java` – application entry point

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
3. Run the `Main.java` file.
